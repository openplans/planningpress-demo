planningpress-demo
==================

The demo instance of planningpress. Essentially, this repo contains WordPress 3.4.1 (which can be downloaded from https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/). None of these files should be modified, except wp-config-sample.php per ["Editing wp-config.php"](https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php).

The planningpress-demo should be [installed per usual](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). After installation, the [planningpress-plugins](https://github.com/openplans/planningpress-plugins) repo should be added to the wp-content/plugins directory and the [planningpress](https://github.com/openplans/planningpress) repo should be added to the wp-content/themes/planningpress directory.
